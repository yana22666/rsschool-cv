<p>I am 22 years old. I am ready to study and learn new things for myself.
I've always liked the design of websites/gaming platforms and everything related to it.
Every time I wonder: how does it work?
And I decided to try myself in this field, because I believe that I have the right qualities to achieve this goal, namely perseverance, patience, stress resistance.
I don't go to conflicts, I don't have bad habits. I hope that in the future I will achieve this goal.</p>
